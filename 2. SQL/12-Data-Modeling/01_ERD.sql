-- ERD (Entity Relationship Diagrams)
-- ERDs are visual representations of the data model, showing entities and their relationships.

-- Example: Entities and their relationships
-- Entities: Person, Orders, Products
-- Relationships:

-- NOTE: ERD is usually a diagram, but this is a textual representation.
-- Diagram tools: Lucidchart, Draw.io, or Microsoft Visio can be used to create ERDs.
