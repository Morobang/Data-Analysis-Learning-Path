-- Denormalization
-- Denormalization is the process of combining tables to reduce the complexity of queries.

-- Example: 
-- Instead of having separate tables for Orders and Products, 
-- denormalizing could mean creating a single table that includes product details with each order.
-- This can improve read performance at the cost of increased storage and potential data anomalies.
